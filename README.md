## General info
This project is purely for showing my skills with Javascript, CSS and HTML. You start with a normal game of Tic Tac Toe until you place a symbol at the edge. When placed at the edge, the board game will expand with the help of procedural generation.

## Technologies
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

## Setup
After cloning the code, you can just open the html file in a modern browser and enjoy playing the game.

## Status
This project is finished. Only 1 bug needs to be fixed regarding the margin of newly generated rows and columns.
